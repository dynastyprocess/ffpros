Helps scrape FantasyPros.com by handling rate-limiting/caching/parsing and returning tidy dataframes which can be easily connected to other data sources.

_Renamed from fpscrapr to ffpros on 2021-06-14 so that all ffverse packages start with ff_

## Installation

Install the stable version of this package from the [ffverse r-universe repository](https://ffverse.r-universe.dev):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ffpros", repos = "https://ffverse.r-universe.dev")
```

Install the development version with either [DynastyProcess's r-universe](https://dynastyprocess.r-universe.dev) or remotes + GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# ffverse's r-universe
install.packages("ffpros", repos = "https://dynastyprocess.r-universe.dev")

# or via GitHub c/o remotes/devtools: # install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("ffverse/ffpros")
```

## Usage

All `ffpros` functions start with fp_ for ease of autocomplete.

The fp_rankings function retrieves fantasy ranks from FantasyPros.com.

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(ffpros)

fp_rankings(page = "consensus-cheatsheets") # defaults to nfl!

fp_rankings(page = "ros-overall", sport = "nhl")
```


Default configuration options are detailed in the [configuration options vignette](https://ffpros.dynastyprocess.com/articles).
